## üéØ Problem & Solution

**The Challenge:** Donors often feel disconnected from the impact of their contributions, leading to reduced engagement and one-time donations rather than sustained support. Meanwhile, nonprofits struggle with manual outreach and content creation.

**Our Solution:** Project REACH Platform bridges this gap by providing:
- **Transparent Impact Tracking**: Real-time visualization of donation progress across schools
- **Personal Stories**: Direct connection to students and schools benefiting from donations  
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Automated prospect research, content generation, and outreach campaigns
- **Gamified Engagement**: Achievement system and milestone tracking to encourage continued giving
- **Streamlined Operations**: Easy package management and school administration tools

Built for the **Morgan Stanley Code to Give Hackathon 2025** in partnership with **Project REACH Hong Kong**.
